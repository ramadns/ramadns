<a id="welcome-to-ramadns" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-ramadns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to RamaDNS!</h2>

<p>The RamaDNS-project is an implementation of both an authorative and a recursive DNS-server. It is a fork of the <a href="http://www.maradns.org/">MaraDNS program</a> by Sam Trenholme (<a href="https://github.com/samboy" class="user-mention">@samboy</a>). </p>

<a id="why-does-ramadns-exist-and-why-was-it-forked-from-maradns" class="anchor" href="#why-does-ramadns-exist-and-why-was-it-forked-from-maradns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does RamaDNS exist and why was it forked from MaraDNS?</h3>

<p>RamaDNS was forked from MaraDNS as MaraDNS is considered complete by its primary author; No new features are planned to be developed and bug fixes and other support functions by the author are only provided after payment. The founder of the RamaDNS-project finds it important that support by and for users remains available, that there is room for new features to be developed, and support is available for all operating systems on which the software can reasonably be expected to work.</p>

<p>As such, RamaDNS is envisioned to be a continuation or further development of MaraDNS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-dns" class="anchor" href="#what-is-dns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is DNS?</h3>

<p>The internet uses numbers, not names, to find computers. DNS is the
   internet's directory service: It takes a name, like "www.ramadns.org",
   and converts that name in to an "IP" number that your computer can use
   to connect to <a href="http://www.ramadns.org">www.ramadns.org</a>.</p>

<p>DNS is one of these things many take for granted that is essential to
   using today's internet. Without DNS, the internet breaks. It is
   critical that a DNS server keeps the internet working in a secure and
   stable manner.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ramadns-history" class="anchor" href="#ramadns-history" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RamaDNS' History</h3>

<p>RamaDNS was started in March 2016 as a fork of MaraDNS 2.0.13.</p>

<p>MaraDNS was started in 2001 in response to concerns that there were
   only two freely available DNS servers (BIND and DjbDNS) at the time.
   MaraDNS 1.0 was released in mid-2002, RamaDNS 1.2 was released in late
   2005, and MaraDNS 2.0 was released in the fall of 2010.</p>

<p>MaraDNS 1.0 used a recursive DNS server that was implemented rather
   quickly and had difficult-to-maintain code. This code was completely
   rewritten for the MaraDNS 2.0 release, which now uses a separate
   recursive DNS server.</p>

<p>MaraDNS was fully maintained and actively developed without needing
   contributions from 2001 until 2010. MaraDNS 2.0 was the final release 
   made without significant financial support. While security and other
   critical bugs are still taken care of, there is no guarantee of any
   technical support above and beyond that. For this reason, RamaDNS forked 
   MaraDNS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>RamaDNS 2.0 consists of two primary components: A UDP-only
   authoritative DNS server for hosting domains, and a UDP and TCP-capable
   recursive DNS server for finding domains on the internet. RamaDNS'
   recursive DNS server is called Deadwood, and it shares no code with
   RamaDNS' authoritative DNS server.</p>

<p>In more detail: RamaDNS has one daemon, the authoritative daemon
   (called "ramadns"), that provides information to recursive DNS servers
   on the internet, and another daemon, the recursive daemon (called
   "Deadwood"), that gets DNS information from the internet for web
   browsers and other internet clients.</p>

<p>A simplified way to look at it: RamaDNS puts your web page on the
   Internet; Deadwood looks for web pages on the Internet.</p>

<p>Deadwood has its own webpage and release schedule. When new RamaDNS
   releases are made, they bundle the current stable version of Deadwood
   in the source code tree; the build scripts compile both RamaDNS and
   Deadwood at the same time.</p>

<p>Since RamaDNS' authoritative daemon does not support TCP, RamaDNS
   includes a separate DNS-over-TCP server called "zoneserver" that
   supports both standard DNS-over-TCP and DNS zone transfers.</p>

<p>Neither RamaDNS nor the UNIX version of Deadwood have support for
   daemonization; this is handled by a separate program included with
   RamaDNS called Duende. Deadwood's Windows port, on the other hand,
   includes support for running as a Windows service.</p>

<p>RamaDNS also includes a simple DNS querying tool called "askrama" and a
   number of other miscellaneous tools: Scripts for processing RamaDNS'
   documentation, a simple webpage password generator, some Unicode
   conversion utilities, scripts for building and installing RamaDNS,
   automated SQA tests, etc.</p>

<p>RamaDNS is a native UNIX program with a partial Windows port. Deadwood,
   RamaDNS' recursive resolver, is a fully cross-platform application with
   a full Windows port.
   RamaDNS 2.0 has full (albeit not fully tested) IPv6 support.</p>

<h3>
<a id="internals" class="anchor" href="#internals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internals</h3>

<p>RamaDNS 2.0's authoritative server uses code going all the way back 
   to 2001. The core DNS-over-UDP server has a number of components,
   including two different zone file parsers, a mararc parser, a secure
   random number generator, and so on.</p>

<p>RamaDNS is written entirely in C. No objective C nor C++ classes are
   used in RamaDNS' code.</p>

<p>RamaDNS 2.0's "Deadwood" recursive server was started in 2007 and has
   far cleaner code. Its random number generator, for example, uses a
   smaller, simpler, and more secure cryptographic algorithm; its
   configuration file parser uses a finite state machine interpreter; its
   handling of multiple simultaneous pending connections is done using
   select() and a state machine instead of with threads.</p>

<p>Deadwood's source code can be browsed online, and there are a
   number of documents describing its internals available.</p>

<h3>
<a id="other-dns-servers" class="anchor" href="#other-dns-servers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other DNS servers</h3>

<p>The landscape of open-source DNS servers has changed greatly since 2001
   when RamaDNS was started. There are now a number of different DNS
   servers still actively developed and maintained: BIND, Power DNS,
   NSD/Unbound, as well as RamaDNS. DjbDNS is no longer being updated and
   the unofficial forks have limited support; notably it took nearly five
   months for someone to come up with a patch for CVE-2012-1191.</p>

<p>RamaDNS' strength is that it's a remarkably small, lightweight, easy to
   configure, and mostly cross-platform DNS server. Deadwood is a tiny DNS
   server with full recursion support, perfect for embedded systems.</p>

<p>RamaDNS' weakness is that it does not have some features other DNS
   servers have. For example, while Deadwood has the strongest spoof
   protection available without cryptography, it does not have support for
   DNSSEC.</p>

<p>As another example, RamaDNS does not have full zone transfer support;
   while RamaDNS can both serve zones and receive external zone files from
   other DNS servers, RamaDNS needs to be restarted to update its database
   of DNS records.</p>

<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h3>

<p>Work is currently (March 31, 2016) underway to launch RamaDNS; As such, we hope to provide further information on here over the course of the coming weeks, and make a first release available. Please note that at this time, the software is not yet suitable for use!</p>

<p>If you are interested in the further development of MaraDNS/RamaDNS, please feel free to clone our project.</p>

<h3>
<a id="credits" class="anchor" href="#credits" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credits</h3>

<p>RamaDNS would not exist if it were not for the many, many hours of dedicated work put into it through the years by Sam. For this, we owe a big thanks to him, and like to express our appreciation for all the efforts he has put into MaraDNS over the year.</p>
