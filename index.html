<a id="welcome-to-ramadns" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-ramadns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to RamaDNS!</h2>

<p>The RamaDNS-project is an implementation of both an authorative and a recursive DNS-server. It is a fork of the <a href="http://www.maradns.org/">MaraDNS program</a> by Sam Trenholme (<a href="https://github.com/samboy" class="user-mention">@samboy</a>). </p>

<a id="why-does-ramadns-exist-or-why-was-it-forked-from-maradns" class="anchor" href="#why-does-ramadns-exist-or-why-was-it-forked-from-maradns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does RamaDNS exist or why was it forked from MaraDNS?</h3>

<p>RamaDNS was forked from MaraDNS as MaraDNS is considered complete by its primary author; No new features are planned to be developed and bug fixes and other support functions by the author are only provided after payment. The founder of the RamaDNS-project finds it important that support by and for users remains available, that there is room for new features to be developed, and support is available for all operating systems on which the software can reasonably be expected to work.</p>

<p>As such, RamaDNS is envisioned to be a continuation or further development of MaraDNS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h3>

<p>Work is currently (March 31, 2016) underway to launch RamaDNS; As such, we hope to provide further information on here over the course of the coming weeks, and make a first release available.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the further development of MaraDNS/RamaDNS, please feel free to clone our project.</p>

<h3>
<a id="credits" class="anchor" href="#credits" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credits</h3>

<p>RamaDNS would not exist if it were not for the many, many hours of dedicated work put into it through the years by Sam. For this, we owe a big thanks to him, and like to express our appreciation for all the efforts he has put into MaraDNS over the year.</p>
